Demo Lua for VLC extension
==========================

Minimum Lua code for writing a VLC extension

Purpose
-------
I decided to play around with VLC and to find how to write a VLC extension.
This code is the minimum code I think you'll need to implement a VLC extension.

Usage
-----
Copy it in the "extension" directory of your VLC installation such as "C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\lua\extensions"
	
How it works?
-------------
Once copied to the "extension" directory, run VLC and click on "view".
You should see a new entry "Demo" (change this entry name at line 10 of demo.lua)
